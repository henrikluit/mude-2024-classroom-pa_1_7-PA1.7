# PA 1.7: Classy Distributions

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.7. Due: before Friday, October 18th, 2024.*

This PA consists of 2 parts:

1. [Programming for Week 1.7](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/book/programming/week_1_7.html) (Online Textbook): read this chapter, which covers object oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
2. `PA_1_7_Classy_Distributions.ipynb`: a notebook OOP and probability distribution exercises.

If you are unfamiliar with the probability concepts, you should also read the [theory chapter for this week](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/book/probability/Reminder_intro.html#).

## Grading Criteria

You will pass this PA if:
1. Your notebook `PA_1_7_Classy_Distributions.ipynb` runs without errors.

You can verify that you passed by looking for the green circle in this repository (the last workflow run).

If your check is failing, view the Python traceback by going to the Actions tab, click the most recent workflow run, click the job (the box diagram) and expand and read the command line interface output.
